# The pages folder

The `pages` folder is the folder that will contain all the webpages.

> **Note:** This is the simpliest part of the project ðŸ˜‰

In the folder called `static`, create a file called `style.css`.

Write in it:
```
body {
  margin: 0;
}
```

Go to https://localhost/static/style.css.

That's all ðŸ¥³
